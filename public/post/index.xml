      <description>In the post XXXX I have shown you how to setup an AWS instance running the newest RStudio, R, python, Julia and so forth, where the choice of performance of the instance can be freely chosen. However, there is quite a lot of possibilities of instance configurations out there, just check out the drop-down menu on the page itself:

These instances differ in two dimensions: price and performance. Obviously, these dimensions are highly correlated, since higher price means (or should mean, at least) higher performance.</description>

      <description>“I am very glad you asked me that, Mrs. Rawlinson. The term ‘holistic’ refers to my conviction that what we are concerned here is the fundamental interconnectedness of things.” Douglas Adams, “Dirk Gently’s Holistic Agency”
 Networks are everywhere. The internet, road infrastructure and even the cast list of a theater show: depending on the interpretation, all kinds of entities can be viewed as networks.
One particularly interesting subset of networks is made up by scientific research papers.</description>

      <description>Setting up an R Environment: Available Anytime, Anywhere? Assume you want to start to write R code (a very good decision, in my opinion) and you want to be able to write and test code whereever you are. Wouldn’t it be awesome if one could set up an environment that can be used for R coding independent of any device? Where all you need is a decent browser, a working internet connection and you’re good to go?</description>
