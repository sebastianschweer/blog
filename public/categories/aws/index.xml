      <description>Assume you want to start to write R code (a very good decision, in my opinion) and you want to be able to write and test code whereever you are. Wouldn’t it be awesome if one could set up an environment that can be used for R coding independent of any device? Where all you need is a decent browser, a working internet connection and you’re good to go?
Obviously, that is the case.</description>

      <description>In a previous postI have shown you how to setup an AWS instance running the newest RStudio, R, Python, Julia and so forth, where the configuration of the instance can be freely chosen. However, there is quite a lot of possibilities of instance configurations out there, just check out the drop-down menu on the page itself:
…why is it ‚nano‘, ‚micro‘ but then ‚large‘ ‚extra large‘? Be consistent, dangit!
 These instances differ in two dimensions: price and performance.</description>
