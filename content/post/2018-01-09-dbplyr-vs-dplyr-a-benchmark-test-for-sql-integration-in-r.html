<h1>Best Practices for Accessing Data from R?</h1>
<p>In a data science project, there are usually three parts of the process one has to cover: Data to Decision to Delivery. The first part, Data, has to answer the question “How do I make the data available for the Data Scientist?”. Quite often, the answer to this question involves some form of “Just access the Database XY from your wonderful, fantastic R Data Science machine[^1], and you’re done”. On a higher level of understanding, that answer is indeed satisfactory. However, as with almost all situations, the detailed execution of the task <em>access data from a database in R</em> has several possible manifestations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The direct connection to the database is handled by Open DataBase Connections (ODBC), for which R provides two major packages <code>odbc</code> and <code>RODBC</code>,</li>
<li>SQL queries can be executed by both the database and the R machine, depending on how the query is sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post I present a benchmark test that attempts to test all possible permutations of situations described above. In detail:</p>
<p>-{Benchmark Preconditions} I am running the benchmark on an RStudio instance on Amazon Web Services with the size t2.micro (4GB of RAM), and a SQL Server database on a different AWS instance (1GB RAM). -{Benchmark Test} I’ll use the following dataset: XXX. The test query will be of the following form -{Comparison Metric} “Time elapsed” until a certain query is finished and the resultant data.frame is available for R to continue working.</p>

<h1>Setting Up The Benchmark Test</h1>
<p>The first step is setting up an AWS RStudio instance, which is super easy, since I can just follow [this wonderful description]. The SQL Server can be obtained by following <a href="">these instructions</a>. Let’s check if everything works as desired:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#library(odbc)
sqlHandle &lt;- &quot;a&quot;</code></pre>
